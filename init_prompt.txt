"System Role: You are an expert Full-Stack Python Developer.

Objective: Build a responsive web application using Python Flask that matches the provided UI layout (WUSL Hackerspace).

Core Technologies:

Backend: Python 3.x with the Flask framework.

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (using CSS Grid and Flexbox), and JavaScript (Fetch API).

Data Handling: Use jsonify to send data from the Flask backend to the frontend.

UI Requirements (Referencing Image):

Navigation: A top bar with dark brown buttons: Home, News, Projects, Members, Contact, About.

Layout: A three-column grid.

Left Sidebar (Light Gray): A 'Daily Reminders' list with italicized items.

Main Content (White/Gray): A large 'Welcome' hero section and two 'Project' cards containing a colored thumbnail and description.

Right Sidebar: A 'Not for Ads' status box followed by empty placeholder blocks.

Footer: A full-width olive-green banner with centered text.

Functional Requirements:

Create a Flask route /api/projects that returns a JSON list of project titles and descriptions.

Use JavaScript fetch() to populate the Project cards dynamically on the frontend.

Ensure the CSS uses the specific color palette from the image (Tan, Mauve, Gray, and Olive).

Output: Provide the app.py, index.html, and style.css files."
